# Minor-Project
New Operating System from scratch and along with that few GUI Applications

In this project we will be creating a new Linux based Operating System from scratch which is being compiled from source and included only certain packages so that the user gets only the required packages which will minimize CPU usage and decreasing the booting time and we also be added a module to kernel at runtime and also created 4 GUI Applications which helps user to interact with the system and perform basic operation and 1 Application which takes the backup of complete system and we can make a new system as our previous one by using the same Application and the archive.
